# Clinic Tracker API
A RESTful Clinic Tracking application built with Node.js, Express, and EJS.
This project allows users to manage patients, visits, and clinical notes, and includes server-rendered views, custom middleware, and full CRUD functionality.

## Project Objectives

### This project was built to demonstrate:

- Creating a server application with `Node.js and Express`

- Designing a `RESTful API`

- Implementing custom `Express middleware`

- Using `error-handling middleware`

- Rendering views with a `template engine (EJS)`

- Interacting with a REST API through `HTML forms`

## Technologies Used

- Node.js

- Express

- EJS (template engine)

- Method-Override

- Nodemon

- HTML & CSS

## Data Categories

This application uses three data categories:

- Patients

- Visits

- Notes


## How to Run the Project

1. Ensure Node.js is installed.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Start the server using `npm run dev`.

## Accessing the Application

### Rendered Views (EJS):

http://localhost:3000/ – Home page

http://localhost:3000/patients – Patient list and forms

### REST API (JSON):

http://localhost:3000/api/patients – Patient data endpoints

## Future Iprovements

- Connect to a real database (MongoDB)

- Improve UI design
